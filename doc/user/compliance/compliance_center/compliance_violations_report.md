#### Separation of duties

GitLab supports a separation of duties policy between users who create and approve merge requests. Our criteria for the
separation of duties is:

- [A merge request author is **not** allowed to approve their merge request](../../project/merge_requests/approvals/settings.md#prevent-approval-by-author).
- [A merge request committer is **not** allowed to approve a merge request they have added commits to](../../project/merge_requests/approvals/settings.md#prevent-approvals-by-users-who-add-commits).
- [The minimum number of approvals required to merge a merge request is **at least** two](../../project/merge_requests/approvals/rules.md).
